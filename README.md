# PlexReport
Tool to report differences in libraries, and collections from one server to another. Especially helpful when moving a plex server from a windows os to a linx OS, as the folders will have vastly different locations. Windows may have drive letters, where as Linux does not use drive letters.

This application reports, creates csv files, and will not change an data in any of the libraries. Using excel, or a database, the csv files can be imported to find differences which may need manual adjustments.
